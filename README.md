elixir-blackjack
=====================

At
[We-Camp](http://we-camp.us/),
the first day is a
[Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/).
This year, the "problem" was
[blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack),
rather than the usual
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

[Paige Bolduc](http://www.paigebolduc.com/)
and
[Dave Aronson](http://www.davearonson.com/)
paired on the next-to-last round.
That round's "twist" was
to code in a "functional" style.
(Most were using a more
[object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
style,
mostly because this event was
essentially a substitute for
[Ruby DCamp](http://rubydcamp.org/)
which wasn't happening in 2017
due to organizer personal reasons.)
As we were both interested in
(albeit somewhat newish to)
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/),
we decided to use that instead of
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

We cheated, sort of.
:-)
At the end of a round of Code Retreat,
you're supposed to delete your code.
But we decided to keep plugging away at it.
Since it looked like it could be fun,
and there was _way_ more to be done
than we could do during We-Camp,
Paige created this GitHub repo.
(And so that Dave could submit a pull request,
the last one he needed for a
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
shirt.)

If others wish to submit PRs,
I suppose we would be okay with that,
but this is mainly an exercise
for us to sharpen our Elixir-fu.
So, a contribution more in line with what we're after would be critique.
Please be gentle;
remember that we did most of this
with no Internet access
nor much beyond the very basic Elixir tooling.  :-)
